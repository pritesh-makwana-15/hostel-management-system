FINAL CLAUDE AI PROMPT
(React + CSS | SAME-TO-SAME | 3-Screen Responsive)

You are a senior frontend developer and UI engineer.

I have uploaded three reference images of an HMS Admin Dashboard (Main Page):

Desktop

Tablet

Mobile

⚠️ ABSOLUTE RULE

Build the UI SAME-TO-SAME as the uploaded images

❌ Do NOT redesign

❌ Do NOT change spacing, layout, or hierarchy

❌ Do NOT improvise UI/UX decisions

The uploaded images are the single source of truth.

🎯 GOAL

Convert the uploaded HMS Admin Dashboard designs into a production-ready frontend using:

✅ React JSX (component-based)

✅ Normal CSS (component-based CSS files)

❌ NO Tailwind

❌ NO inline styles

❌ NO UI libraries (MUI, Ant, Bootstrap, etc.)

👉 Frontend only (no backend, no API logic)

🧠 IMPORTANT FOR CLAUDE

If ANY detail is unclear from images:

❗ ASK before coding

If you need:

Project setup (Vite / CRA)

Font import

Icon strategy (SVG / icon font)

👉 ASK ME FIRST — do not assume

🔒 FINAL NOTE

This is ONLY the Admin Dashboard main page.
All future admin pages will reuse this exact layout and design system.
